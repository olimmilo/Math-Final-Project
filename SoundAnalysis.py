"""
PART ONE
"""

#imports the raw sound and turns it into workable data

#converts the raw sound into a proscessed form which can be used to find the amplitude functions

#finds the linear and quartic amplitude functions

"""
PART TWO
"""

#uses the FFT algoritm to proscess the raw sound into its component pure tones and amplitudes therein

#finds the local maxima of the FFT function to determine the discrete component pure tones

"""
Part Three
"""

#Creates a list of each individual pure tone

#combines pure tones and amplitude functions into in composite sound wave

"""
Graphing
"""

#Graphs the raw soundwave against the two amplitude functions

#Graphs the Fourier Transform of the raw sound wave against a scatter plot of the discretely selected frequencies

#Graphs the composite wave forms using the two different amplitude functions
